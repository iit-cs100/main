In this assignment, you will research a recent or emerging CS-related technology and the related ethical issues.

The paper should:
- cite and discuss at least **five** relevant articles -- these should be from varied sources (e.g., journalists, academics, others).
- provide a summary of what the technology is and how it works, at least at a high-level
- describe in depth the key ethical issues raised by this technology
- describe the arguments on both sides of the issue
- articulate your own argument/opinion on the issue
- be 5-7 pages long, double-spaced
- be uploaded as a PDF file.

The topic of the paper is up to you, as long as it is relevant to CS and ethics. You are welcome to use one of the topics we discussed in class, but your paper should go in more depth than we discussed in class, including summarizing additional articles.

Here are some tips on writing papers: <https://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/writ-pap.htm>

The final paper should be uploaded by 11/28.
